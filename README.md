# Data Science Using R and Python  

This is a repository for data science practical work using both **R** and **Python**.  
This collection includes hands-on experiments, learning notebooks, and mini-projects focused on real-world data tasks.  
The main objective is to build a strong foundation in data science concepts while exploring how both languages can complement each other in solving analytical problems.

## What This Repo Is About  

This repo is a collection of small and medium-sized projects, practice notebooks, and code snippets that I’ve worked on while learning topics like:  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering and selection  
- Machine learning model building  
- Text and sentiment analysis  
- And comparing how things work in R vs Python

## Step 3: Install Required Libraries  

If you get import errors, just install the missing libraries:  

### For Python:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn
```
## Topics Covered  

- **Data Preprocessing** – removing nulls, encoding, feature scaling  
- **Feature Engineering** – combining, splitting, and creating new features  
- **Text Processing** – TF-IDF, cleaning text, and sentiment analysis  
- **Feature Selection** – Chi-Square, Mutual Information, and ANOVA  
- **Model Building** – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.  
- **Evaluation** – Accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix  
- **R vs Python** – seeing how both ecosystems solve similar problems
